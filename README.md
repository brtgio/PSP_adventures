# PSP_adventures
A psp programming repository started in 2023                              
I'm using PSPSDK for all my code and visual studio 2010 as IDE. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SDK can be found: 
here --->https://darksectordds.github.io/html/MinimalistPSPSDK/index.html

You'll have to find a visual studio copy online, this is the easiest way to
code for PSP now a days.
I could'nt get the SDK working under ubuntu 22.04, hope this repository helps
someone else to start coding homebrew, as the PSP it's one of the best 
handhelds ever made.
